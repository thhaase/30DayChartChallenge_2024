"JohnJack14","The Matrix: Reloaded expends upon the universe and themes of it's predecessor. However, the exposition isn't conveyed to the audience nearly as well as it was in the original. The amount of verbal exposition dumped on the audience makes the plot confusing to follow and uninteresting. Despite the lackluster storytelling there are moments to be enjoyed such as the action sequences. The visual effects haven't aged well, it doesn't take away from incredible choreography.","02 Apr 2024",3

Can you imagine a blockbuster follow-up today that essentially subverts everything that the original laid out while holding the viewer at arm's length from catharsis vis a vis multiple philosophical treatises about the nature of existence and choice? Granted, the expansion into Zion introduces too many side characters that are nowhere near as interesting as the starting lineup of Reeves, Fishburne, and Moss.
