"JohnJack14","The Matrix: Reloaded expends upon the universe and themes of it's predecessor. However, the exposition isn't conveyed to the audience nearly as well as it was in the original. The amount of verbal exposition dumped on the audience makes the plot confusing to follow and uninteresting. Despite the lackluster storytelling there are moments to be enjoyed such as the action sequences. The visual effects haven't aged well, it doesn't take away from incredible choreography.","02 Apr 2024",3

"leti","The highway sequence (car chase shootout, into motorcycle weaving through oncoming traffic, into kung fu atop a moving semi-truck) is the absolute gold standard for every action movie since 2003.

This is nowhere near a terrible film, but when compared to its predecessor I will admit that in some aspects, it's inferior. The whole team behind this film returns, including The Wachowski’s, but this time around, it felt more like a fun action sci-fi film…","01 Apr 2024",4

On this rewatch I was also reminded how much I love to say Merovingian. But seriously, it’s still INSANE that that exposition dump from the Architect is in a film of this magnitude.","01 Apr 2024",3

Ich denke, der Film hat immer noch seinen intellektuellen Anspruch, aber er ist einfach nicht mehr der kleine Indie-Film und muss daher für die große Leinwand Kompromisse eingehen.","",2

Can you imagine a blockbuster follow-up today that essentially subverts everything that the original laid out while holding the viewer at arm's length from catharsis vis a vis multiple philosophical treatises about the nature of existence and choice? Granted, the expansion into Zion introduces too many side characters that are nowhere near as interesting as the starting lineup of Reeves, Fishburne, and Moss. But hey, it's relatively minor bloat for such an ambitious enterprise. And the action set pieces are dynamite.","20 Jan 2024",5

A great sequel, and I can’t wait to watch the last two, and see how great they hold up. The imagery is so dynamic, the characters are explosively written, and the story is just so thought out and displays a spirit of brilliance. Neo talking to the architect is such a powerful scene, both exchanging deep and profound thoughts, while brining the reality of Trinity’s state.","13 Jan 2024",4

If the fights were each cut down a couple of minutes and focus less on the choreography of the fights (they were cool but looked lame when we know neo can handle up on them easy) could’ve had a movie near the level of the first one. This movie was just so much less badass than the first one, which really hurts it, but damn if I’m not interested in this story","08 Jan 2024",3
