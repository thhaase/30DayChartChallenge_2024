"benzostraydogs","If you’re going to be forced to return to your wrapped story by the suits (agents), make it your own again and don’t let the bastards box your art in. That’s exactly what Lana Wachowski manages with The Matrix Resurrections. Simultaneously a lament, a battle cry, and an ode, we are once more asked to confront ourselves, our society, and interrogate the choices we have made in the intervening years since The Matrix hit movie theaters like a freight train 25 years ago. The answers will take time, but Lana Wachowski lit a new beacon signaling we can break the chains binding us to reality.","01 Apr 2024","★★★★½",4

The final such sequence is very good, though. The whole movie is maybe a tad long? Maybe. I can appreciate that this series isn’t really for me, and I can still feel the passion throughout. I really wanted to like it, but I just didn’t. Happy 25 years to this franchise and all the love to the Wachowskis for making it.","01 Apr 2024","★★★★½",4

Spite towards every single insufferable trend in big franchises such as legasequels and a refusal to let go, but also a great ode from Lana Wachowski to her and her sister’s creation.

Anyways, I really loved this movie, it's a different take on The Matrix but I feel it had a good direction and vision for it that modernized it well and sorta turned it into a nice sci-fi romance. I think the only thing I would change would be to make the action a bit more interesting, but besides that it's far more interesting than the previous Matrix sequels, and the less cynical feel made me all warm and fuzzy inside at times.","01 Apr 2024","★",1

"Luke SP","watched sometime in Feb and couldn't be fucked to review it then. wasn't even going to bother reviewing this at first. in short: sucked badly. is far too meta for its own good and plays off the nostalgia factor for the other movies. this film cannot stand on its own at all, i think 25% of the footage is just flashbacks of footage from the original trilogy. the ""new Morpheus"" was a fun character, but that can't save the movie for me","25 Mar 2024","★",1

Tie that all together with some bad pacing and you have this sorry excuse for a film.","10 Mar 2024","★★",2
"Ж𝔸𝕍ᐯｉ𝐢єг","Feel conflicted on this one. I think its heart is very much in the right place. There's a lot of meta commentary that I love, and feels like a great and wholly original continuation of The Matrix. But there's a lot of trash in the mix too. Keanu's acting sucks, the action sequences are boring, there's so much exposition and explaining throughout. I think this movie has a lot of value, but the execution is just not fantastic really. It's def better than Revolutions, that's for sure.","10 Mar 2024","★★½",2

Soffre (come tanti altri film delle Wachoswki) di troppi temi e sottotrame che vengono aperti senza avere mai il tempo (e la capacità) di evolversi e concludersi con soddisfazione. È inoltre una sorta di frankenstein, costruito legando tra loro tre diversi film: di questi, ho amato il primo, ignorato il secondo, e riso al terzo.

Entry in the franchise.I personally love it, the wow factor that popularised the series might be gone and the action scenes toned down, though what scenes we do get are still fun, especially a car chase sequence towards the climax does take a step towards that CGI spectacle of the series.But the bulk of this story isn't trying to be that, it's a meta self…","27 Mar 2024","★★★★★",5
"notmygoat","Ugh so much to LOVE about this movie. Yet so many stretches where I wanted a bit more. As always everything in the actual Matrix was incredible and I wish the story had more time in it. New characters were cool for the most part, some much more than others. The classic Matrix stylistically we’re there fighting to be seen but visually the movie is insanely good. The first hour I was prepared to say this was a masterpiece but it sort of tailed off second half for me. But yeah good movie even if I’m just partial to these films and the Wachowskis.","27 Mar 2024","★★★",3

"Sherlock","Grief is just love with no place to go and Lana Wachowski channels some of that love in resuscitating The Matrix verse with a self-reflexive and uncompromised vision. The sequel's real seduction is not just the recontexualisation of Matrix but the construction of whole fantasy itself while also questioning the very basis of things that made that fantasy so charming over the years. What's new with the sequel is that Resurrection sees itself seeing itself see it, a metafiction, revived…","25 Mar 2024","★★★★",4

"creatvesmthng","No it doesn't hold a candle to that trilogy but, that's...kinda the point? Pretty much a giant middle finger to WB and Matrix fans who totally didn't get it.

"Mats Frey","Now that’s how to take a studios money and shit on them the entire run time! Almost every scene works as a way to say “fuck you!” to the studio system (aka the Matrix) and keep a lively spirit and still tell a good story. Who doesn’t love a heist am I right?","24 Mar 2024","★★",2

Há algumas coisas que incomodam ao mesmo tempo que possui ideias interessantes. Tem um tom mais leve do que a trilogia, e tem mais a falar sobre o que é a obra Matrix do que a sua mitologia em si. Não é maravilhoso, mas não chega ser um péssimo filme.","24 Mar 2024","★★",2

"WongKarWaifu","J'ai trouvé le premier tiers du film fascinant au sens premier du terme : je n'arrivais pas à en croire mes yeux tant Matrix Resurrections est une anomalie dans le Hollywood des années 2020. Ce côté meta et par ailleurs résolument politique m'inspire toute la sympathie du monde mais a aussi contribué à rendre la déception d'autant plus grande quand le film a cessé d'être un OVNI autoréférenciel pour en redevenir un blockbuster américain assez bête.

But there's something deeper here that I'd missed before about loss, longing, identity (perhaps not actually a surprise given the director's experiences) and an interesting commentary on mental health issues.

Soffre (come tanti altri film delle Wachoswki) di troppi temi e sottotrame che vengono aperti senza avere mai il tempo (e la capacità) di evolversi e concludersi con soddisfazione. È inoltre una sorta di frankenstein, costruito legando tra loro tre diversi film: di questi, ho amato il primo, ignorato il secondo, e riso al terzo.

However, it developed into something I truly liked. I don't think a new matrix movie could have been made much better than this, regardless of whether it were to be released twenty years after its predecessor. I think a lot of people hated this movie because they had kind of forgotten…","","★★",2

Neo is probably at his strongest as a character, the action, while not as energetic as Matrix or Reloaded, is well done, and incorporates Neo’s new powers really well. Love Smith and The Analyst, great concepts realised by charismatic actors, but, much like Revolutions, what sells this one is really Trinity. I love her character,…","15 Feb 2024","★★",2

The Lana Wachowski that made the original series has changed, not only in her transition, but her direction style has changed and this movie reflects much of that change. It looses some steam by the end, possibly as a result of Covid-19 and then completing the movie under certain restrictions, but I still ultimately enjoyed the imperfect result","09 Mar 2023",NA,NA

"vp4","The first act and the last act of this movie is really bad. Very boring and just uninteresting this movie really didn't happen in the ending. Just doesn't make sense. Also Keanu reuses acting is really bad","20 Jan 2024","★★",2

"Specialek","Nieudana próba zrobienia meta-Matrixa. Nawet jeśli 2 i 3 część niedomagały fabularnie, to nadrabiały to scenami walki. Tutaj sceny walki są fatalne.","25 Dec 2021","★★",2

"Popuuu","There is so much going on, in all the right ways. The best 'meta' piece of media made, with such sincerity but also frustration for the current state of culture.","21 Jan 2024","★★½",2

NA,"this movie is cute as hell tbh, but it's unfortunate that the romance this movie is structured around has zero chemistry.

"PaulMuni","not good at all. no need to be made besides a cash grab all the way. It was amazing that it did not make enough money to justify more sequels, saved us all from bad movies.","20 Jan 2024","★½",1
