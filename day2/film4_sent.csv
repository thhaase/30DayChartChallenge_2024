"4356","Bobo Yog","Arriving 18 years after the conclusion of the original trilogy, The Matrix Resurrections is a legacy sequel that sees co-writer and director Lana Wachowski return to the series that put The Wachowskis on the map. The film takes some meta pokes at the concept of legacy sequels by having Thomas Anderson be introduced as the designer of a video game trilogy called The Matrix, of which he is being asked by his business partner Smith to create a new sequel.‚Ä¶","07 Jan 2023",NA,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,5
