Set in a dystopian future where humanity is enslaved by intelligent machines, the story follows Neo, a computer hacker who discovers the truth about reality: humans are living in a simulated world called the Matrix. As Neo delves deeper into this virtual reality, he grapples with existential questions about identity, free will, and the nature of existence. The film's innovative visual effects, including ""bullet time"" photography, revolutionized action cinema, while its philosophical underpinnings continue to inspire discussion and analysis.","23 Mar 2024",4,2,4,2,1,2,1,0,5,2,10

"6903","Cgates","You can really see how much bigger this sequel is compared to its original stronger vfx and bigger choreography while still have that honk kong feel to it. However I think that the film gets bogged down in its own ambition by adding small details to the world and not exploring those ideas. Like the Vampires and ghost from a previous matrix. And the over use of a PS2 Neo during the fight scene with all the smiths. Smith is also a brilliant villain and Hugo weveing it‚Äôs brilliant.
