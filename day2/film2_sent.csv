"8","JohnJack14","The Matrix: Reloaded expends upon the universe and themes of it's predecessor. However, the exposition isn't conveyed to the audience nearly as well as it was in the original. The amount of verbal exposition dumped on the audience makes the plot confusing to follow and uninteresting. Despite the lackluster storytelling there are moments to be enjoyed such as the action sequences. The visual effects haven't aged well, it doesn't take away from incredible choreography.","02 Apr 2024",3,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,1

For the most part The Matrix Reloaded (2003) gets it's excitement from the action sequences, which some have improved. A lot of the characters and story about destiny feel like complete fluff in this one. There aren't many themes explored that will break your mind.

"3872",NA,"I've heard the Matrix sequels maligned for so long that it was almost shocking to me how much fun I had watching this. But the Wachowskis and their go-all-out style of action filmmaking with a healthy helping of queer undertones and ""the answer is love!!"" messaging pretty much always hit for me, so in retrospect, my enjoyment of this movie is no surprise at all.

BUT, they make up for it with some of the greatest action sequences ever put to cinema. As of right now though, I still like the OG Matrix as a standalone film.","25 Nov 2023",4,0,2,1,0,2,0,0,2,2,4

"3887",NA,"I do not know what to think of this film, it's strangely likable but so bizarre. I think it does overcomplicate the whole idea of the matrix, with versions and programmes ect. Which kind of leaves alot of questions for the viewer. However the main plot thread of Neo becoming the one still holds true and keeps me engaged.
